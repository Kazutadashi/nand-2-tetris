# nand-2-tetris
This is my iteration of the project nand2tetris. This course was created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It focuses on building a modern computer using first principles of comptuer science. My project uses the software suite and files provided on their website https://www.nand2tetris.org for a majority of the course work. 

For chip designs and graphics, I am using the free software called Logisim, provided on their website:
